# LedMatrixDriver

In this project I reversed engineered a big led matrix which is used on the front of public transport busses. After reverse engineering this and documenting it in a schematic I started writing the low-level driver code and user libraries. The user library includes different fonts to use. The result is that a user can simply give a string to the library function and the text will appear on the led matrix.
